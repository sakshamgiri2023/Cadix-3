# Description

The "Bus Reservation and Ticketing System" is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage bus ticket reservations. It allows users to book bus tickets for various destinations, view transaction details, and make payments. This system can be used by bus operators to manage passenger reservations efficiently.

# Features
User authentication: The system requires users to log in with a username and password. The default credentials are "admin" for both username and password.
Destination information: Users can view available destinations, including their names, fares, and the number of available seats.
Ticket booking: Users can book tickets by specifying their name, choosing a destination, specifying the number of passengers, and indicating how many of them qualify for discounts (e.g., students, PWD, or senior citizens).
Ticket transaction: The system calculates the total fare for the booked ticket, considering discounts if applicable. It also tracks the payment status of each passenger.
Viewing passenger details: Users can search for passengers by name and view their booking details, including fare, seat, payment status, and more.
Transaction history: The system keeps a record of passenger details, including their destination, fare, number of passengers, and payment status.
User-friendly menu: The system uses a text-based menu to guide users through the ticketing process, making it easy to navigate.
